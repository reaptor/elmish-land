# Elmish Land 1.1: Smarter CLI Tooling

Version 1.1 of Elmish Land brings significant improvements to the CLI, focusing on automation and better error handling. Here's what changed since 1.0.

## Automatic Project File Management

F# requires explicit file ordering in `.fsproj` files. Version 1.0 made you handle this manually whenever you added pages or layouts. Version 1.1 automates it entirely ([#29](https://github.com/reaptor/elmish-land/issues/29)).

When you add pages or layouts, the CLI now:
- Adds files to your project in the correct order
- Maintains compilation dependencies
- Preserves existing Content entries
- Handles mixed path separators correctly

## Interactive Prompts

The CLI now offers to fix common problems instead of just reporting them.

### Layout Reference Fixes

When you run `build` or `server`, the CLI validates layout references. If a page uses `Layout.Msg` when it should use `About.Layout.Msg`, you get a clear error message identifying the page and the issue. The CLI then offers to fix it automatically with an interactive prompt.

### Page Reordering

When files need reordering in your project, the CLI shows a preview of the changes and asks for confirmation before making updates.

## Solution File Generation

Running `init` now generates a solution file automatically ([#22](https://github.com/reaptor/elmish-land/issues/22)), which improves the experience in Visual Studio and Rider.

## Better Feedback

Commands like `init`, `build`, `restore`, and `server` now show loading indicators. Use `--verbose` for detailed output.

## Bug Fixes

- Commands from Shared.init now work properly ([#34](https://github.com/reaptor/elmish-land/issues/34))
- Fixed nested layout assignment issues ([#21](https://github.com/reaptor/elmish-land/issues/21))
- Route parameters can use F# keywords like "new" ([#25](https://github.com/reaptor/elmish-land/issues/25))
- Validation only checks pages included in the project file ([#28](https://github.com/reaptor/elmish-land/issues/28))
- Fixed Shared module command handling ([#27](https://github.com/reaptor/elmish-land/issues/27))

## Getting Started

Update your installation:

```bash
dotnet tool update elmish-land --prerelease
```

Or install fresh:

```bash
dotnet new tool-manifest
dotnet tool install elmish-land --prerelease
dotnet elmish-land init
```
